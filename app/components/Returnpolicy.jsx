        <p>We hope you will love everything you purchase from us but if something isn't quite right, you have <strong>3 days</strong> from the day the order has been received to make an exchange.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Please keep in mind that a package unboxing video will need to be sent to us prior to the exchange.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>If you wish to exchange your purchased item you can email your order number to: omomailbox@gmail.com</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Items can only be exchanged into different sizes. All exchanges are subject to product availability.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>We ask that items are returned clean, unworn, and in the same condition as when you received them. Any items that are not in a condition suitable for resale (i.e. used, washed, or damaged), will not be exchanged and will be sent back to you.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Exchanges for defective items will be sent without shipping cost.</p>
